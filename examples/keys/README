The RSA key-pairs in this folder have been created for the purpose of testing.
Feel free to use them further on for testing but don't use them in a productive environment, \
since the private key files are available publicly via downloads of this app.

When generating your own key pairs note that
  1. The format supported by TA-cryptosuite is PEM.
  2. Using 1024 bit keys is considered unsafe and therefore forbidden in TA-cryptosuite.
  3. Unfortunately key encryption is not yet supported.

Examples for key generation as used for generating the test key-pairs:

  openssl genrsa -out private.pem 1024
  openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -RSAPublicKey_out -out public.pem
  ---> These keys won't work.

  openssl genrsa -aes256 -passout pass:1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstu -out private_aes256.pem 2048
  openssl rsa -in private_aes256.pem -outform PEM -RSAPublicKey_out -out public_aes256.pem
  openssl rsa -in private_aes256.pem -outform DER -out public_aes256.der

  openssl genrsa -des -passout pass:1234567890abcdef -out private_des.pem 2048
  openssl rsa -in private_des.pem -outform PEM -RSAPublicKey_out -out public_des.pem
  openssl rsa -in private_des.pem -outform DER -out public_des.der
